' Understanding Reverse Indexing with PostgreSQL

This repository explores the concept of reverse indexing using PostgreSQL, a powerful relational database management system. Reverse indexing is a technique commonly used in search engines and databases to quickly locate documents or records based on keywords or phrases. The primary purpose of this repository is to provide developers with a deeper understanding of the GIN built-in function of PostgreSQL. By coding the reverse indexing process manually, developers can gain insight into how the GIN function works under the hood.

## Overview
The script provided in this repository demonstrates how to implement reverse indexing in PostgreSQL step by step, using a sample dataset and a modified version of Dylan Thomas' poem "Do not go gentle into that good night".

## How to Use
To understand reverse indexing with PostgreSQL, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up PostgreSQL:** Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed on your system. You can download it from the [official PostgreSQL website](https://www.postgresql.org/).
   
2. **Run the Script:** Execute the provided SQL script in your PostgreSQL environment. This script will create tables, insert data, create indexes, and perform search operations.
   
3. **Explore the Code:** Dive into the script and understand each step of the reverse indexing process. Pay attention to how keywords, stop words, and word stems are handled to optimize search efficiency.
   
4. **Experiment:** Modify the script or dataset to experiment with different scenarios. Try adding new documents, changing keywords, or adjusting stop words to see how it affects search results.
   
5. **Review Index Operations:** Take a closer look at index operations by examining the query plan, available index methods, and index status. This will deepen your understanding of how PostgreSQL handles indexing.

## Key Concepts
- **Reverse Indexing:** Reverse indexing is a technique where documents or records are indexed based on their content, allowing for fast and efficient search operations.
  
- **GIN Index:** Generalized Inverted Index (GIN) is a type of index in PostgreSQL that is well-suited for indexing composite values like arrays and full-text search.
  
- **Stop Words:** Stop words are common words (e.g., "and", "the", "is") that are often filtered out during indexing to improve search performance and reduce index size.
  
- **Word Stems:** Word stemming is the process of reducing words to their root or base form (e.g., "teaching" to "teach") to improve search recall and match variations of words.
