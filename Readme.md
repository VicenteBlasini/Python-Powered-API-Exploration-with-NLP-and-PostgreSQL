# Python-Powered API Exploration with NLP and PostgreSQL

## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts for exploring the API, performing Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, and storing the data in a PostgreSQL database. The project demonstrates how to fetch data from an API, analyze text using NLP techniques, and interact with a relational database.

## Files

1. **pokemon.py**:
   - This Python script connects to the PokeAPI and fetches data for # Pok√©mon.
   - It then stores the fetched data in a PostgreSQL database.
   - The script demonstrates fetching data from an API, working with JSON data, and interacting with a PostgreSQL database.

2. **hidden.py**:
   - This module contains functions to retrieve sensitive information like database connection parameters.
   - It provides functions to return credentials for different environments, such as development, production, or testing.

3. **myutils.py**:
   - This module contains utility functions for database operations.
   - It includes functions for querying values, querying rows, and executing queries.

4. **swapi.py**:
   - This Python script pulls data from the swapi.py4e.com API and inserts it into a PostgreSQL table named 'swapi'.
   - It demonstrates fetching data from an external API, handling HTTP requests, and interacting with a PostgreSQL database.

## Usage

To use these scripts:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Set up PostgreSQL and create a database for storing the data.
4. Update the database connection parameters in `hidden.py`.
5. Run the desired Python script to fetch data from the PokeAPI or other sources and store it in the PostgreSQL database.
